Interpreter

(Jan 2023 - Apr 2023)

The interpreter is a Java-based project designed for a custom programming language. 
It includes a lexer and parser to process and translate language syntax into executable code, 
an execution engine to handle variable assignments, arithmetic operations, and control flow statements. 
The interpreter effectively manages the translation and execution of basic programming constructs.
